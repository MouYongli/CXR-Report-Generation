# DCL
Official code for "Dynamic Graph Enhanced Contrastive Learning for Chest X-ray Report Generation" (CVPR 2023)

In this paper, we present a practical approach to leverage dynamic graph to enhance contrastive learning for radiology report generation. In which the dynamic graph is constructed in a bottom-up manner to integrate retrieved specific knowledge with general knowledge. Then contrastive learning is employed to improve visual and textual representations, which also promises the accuracy of our dynamic graph. Experiments on two popular benchmarks verify the effectiveness of our method in generating accurate and meaningful reports
